## Software and Tools

This project implements Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks using PyTorch. Below are the main tools and libraries that have been utilized:

### Main Dependencies
- **PyTorch**: An open-source machine learning library used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR).
- **NumPy**: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

### Installation
To install PyTorch and other necessary libraries, run the following command:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy
